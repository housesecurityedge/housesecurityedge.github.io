Prepare yourself to pay out several hundred dollars for simply your starter kit. Fobs and keypads - Some wise alarms include keypads and fobs that make arming and deactivating the alarm simpler than by means of the mobile phone app. This might work if you have pet walkers, cleaners or others that may let themselves in and out of your home when you're not there.</p>

<p>In The Sims 2, a burglar alarm will cover the entire room it is positioned in. Alarm systems can not be positioned outdoors, unless the moveobjects cheat is used.

The moment you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to plane mode is the moment you've left your house open. If you aren't cautious, this open hole in your security can prove to be a huge problem. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a problem.
