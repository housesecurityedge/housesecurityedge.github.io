<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
