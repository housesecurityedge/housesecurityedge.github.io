The sensor can also start a push alert to your phone when activity is happening, and some will likewise generate an email alert.

<p>Just a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a few huge names providing costly, stiff strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
