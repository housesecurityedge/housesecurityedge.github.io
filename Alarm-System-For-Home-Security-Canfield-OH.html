<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Bullet cameras are long and round fit and are perfect for outdoor use. Their strengths lie specifically in applications which require far away viewing. Set up within protective casings, the cameras are protected versus dust, dirt and other natural elements. The cameras can quickly be installed with a mounting bracket, and come fitted with either fixed or varifocal lenses depending on the requirements of its designated application. </p>
