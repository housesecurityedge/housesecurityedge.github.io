<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The clever bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must automatically know.</p>
<p>Some homeowners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll prevent potential intruders. These signs might be attached to a front door, a popular window, published in the front backyard, or at the top of a driveway. The idea of posting a security alarm sign is that potential criminals may not want to take a gamble about whether the sign shows the presence of a home security system.</p>
