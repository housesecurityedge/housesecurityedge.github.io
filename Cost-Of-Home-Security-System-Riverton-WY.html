<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
