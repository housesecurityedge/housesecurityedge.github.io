False burglar alarm" indicates a burglar alarm dispatch request when the reacting police officer discovers no evidence of a criminal offense after having finished a prompt examination of the alarm site.</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should suffice to frighten trespassers in many cases. To hold and recover costs alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to require police reaction.</p>
