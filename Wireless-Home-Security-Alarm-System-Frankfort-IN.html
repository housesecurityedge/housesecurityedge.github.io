<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
