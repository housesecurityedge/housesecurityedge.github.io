<p>Increase safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The Ring Stick Up Webcam is available in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. However neither can record continuously, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to catch recordings. Also, the wired variation typically left spaces of approximately 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips.
