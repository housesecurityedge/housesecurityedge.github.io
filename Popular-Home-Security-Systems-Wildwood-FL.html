After using designs long-term for over a year, in addition to testing several new models, we still think the Logitech Circle 2 is the very best indoor security camera.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months.</p>
