<p>Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Security cameras that are part of a monitored security system usually have the exact same features and alternatives as stand-alone cameras. Keep cameras off your home wifi network. Alarm monitoring is not just an inexpensive method to safeguard your home or business from burglary, medical and fire emergency situations, but it may pay for itself! Many insurance provider provide premium discounts to professionally monitored alarm customers - in some cases up to 20% off. </p>
