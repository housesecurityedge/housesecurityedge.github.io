<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
