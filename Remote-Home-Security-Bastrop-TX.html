<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level.
