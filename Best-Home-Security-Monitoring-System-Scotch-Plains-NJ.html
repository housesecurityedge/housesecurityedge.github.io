<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings.

For repairing, you have the option of either a strong magnetic ball install or a standard tripod screw.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the porch by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Pan and tilt: If you're seeing family pets or older kids from another location from the office or on a beach, you may want to have the ability to move the camera angle.
