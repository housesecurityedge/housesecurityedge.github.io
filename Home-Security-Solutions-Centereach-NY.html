<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year contract, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. However if you may update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
