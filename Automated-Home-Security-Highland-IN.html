<p>These cameras are capable of capturing and transferring really sensitive information," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory. That's why we test them for information security and data personal privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or someone, primarily to prevent or identify criminal offense.

<p>Nevertheless, convenience doesn't always include included security. Going from wired to wireless security suggests potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks if you don't do it right. You do not need to go into a house to cut the wire with wireless," the method you would with wired security, alerts Du. Without taking the proper security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home available to burglars who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors getting their existence.</p>
<p>The huge perk is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that doesn't look like a home security system.

Similarly, it will arm itself immediately when everybody has left.</p>
