<p>Another essential topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>

If a dubious bad guy was quick enough, they could surpass the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>
