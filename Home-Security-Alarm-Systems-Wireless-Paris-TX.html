<p>Another essential topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of an issue is between tape-recording and discovering motion. It takes a second for the camera to in fact turn on when it spots motion since the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording. If a dubious bad guy was quick enough, they could surpass the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>
