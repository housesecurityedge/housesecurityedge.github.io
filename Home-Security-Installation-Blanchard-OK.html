<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all.

Technically, many home security cameras support infrared LED illumination, versus real night vision based upon image climax or thermal vision.
