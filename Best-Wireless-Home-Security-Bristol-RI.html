It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>When I ultimately entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory.
