<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
