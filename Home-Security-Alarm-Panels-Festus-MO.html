<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over cross countries.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
