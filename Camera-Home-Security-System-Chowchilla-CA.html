Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more pricey for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>One of the top home security service providers since getting in the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for numerous thousands of clients around the United States and Canada. They use flexibility in their equipment and readily available strategies, permitting property owners to select the security solution that best matches their requirements. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to Protect America indicated by their low C- score from BBB. A bulk of the grievances center around misinformation regarding the mandatory three year agreement. In reality, many customers were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, paired with the extreme charge for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some pause in picking Protect America as their home security solution.</p>
