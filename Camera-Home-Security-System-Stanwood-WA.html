<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
