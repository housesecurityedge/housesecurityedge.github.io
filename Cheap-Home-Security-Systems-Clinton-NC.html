The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
