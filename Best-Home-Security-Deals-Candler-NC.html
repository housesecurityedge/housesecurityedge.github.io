<p>Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera gives you an excellent field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.) To see that video, you can use an app on your phone or a web browser link on your computer system.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a bit more if you want to add extra functions, like a security camera.

Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>The biggest, baddest feature is the Arlo Ultra's 4K video streaming with HDR, which provides you exceptionally crisp, clear footage that lets you focus on information like faces and license plates without screwing up your image quality. The Nest Labs Nest Web cam delivers higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Ramping up into security services fits with this, too.
