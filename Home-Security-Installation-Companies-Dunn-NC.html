<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
