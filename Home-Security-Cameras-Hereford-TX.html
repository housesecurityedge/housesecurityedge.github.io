<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant.

We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is incredibly affordable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
