<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits someone to discover what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Envision a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective service for catching crooks and gathering evidence.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
